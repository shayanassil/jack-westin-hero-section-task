# Hero Section

A responsive hero section implementation showcasing modern web development practices. This is developed for Jack Westin audition task.

NOTE - I took the liberty to add another WHITE FILL (no image) at the bottom of the left image column (750px - 600px viewport sizes) to prevent from showing empty space. This does not affect the original design, spacing and animations, and only appears exactly at the mentioned range of vieport sizes.
